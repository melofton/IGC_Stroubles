#This code identifies "storms" (continuous periods of high discharge). To record them, it adds a cell in the column "Storm_ID" containing the start date and time of the storm to each row within the storm event.
#Na values within "Storm_ID" mean that the row is not within a storm. Further code using Storm_ID should reflect this, of course.
#This also contains a section of code calculating each storm's discharge volume. It adds the measurement to a new column, "Vol_m^3," for each row within the storm's time period.

#This version identifies a storm both when discharge drops below the 90th percentile, and when it's been over an hour since the last "storm" row. To do this, it works with the full, finalized dataset instead of only the portion including storms. 
#We identify the same number of storms with this method (I don't think there are all that many events where discharge bottoms out RIGHT below the 90th percentile and then jumps back up over it within the hour), but it's good to be thorough.
